                <li> 1/2 tablespoon of Sea Salt</li>
                <li>4-5 Stalks of Green oions- chopped very fine </li>
                <li> 2-3 cloves of Garlic- minced</li>
                <li>1/4 cup of Olive oil</li>

            </ul>

    <h5><ol> 
        <li><h3>STEP</h3></li>
        Start by heating up some oil in a wide skillet.
        <li><h3>STEP</h3></li>
        Add the chopped up onions and let them cook for 4-5 mins on med hig heat until they are translucent.
        You can now add the achiote paste and stir it around for a min, I should mention here that I used half the amount of paste for this recipe, which was roughly 3 Tbs.
        <li><h3>STEP</h3></li>
        Add the chicken to the skillet and after about 2 mins add the tomatoes.  Season with some salt.  Add the bell peppers during the last 3 mins of cooking.
        Let it cook uncovered on med high heat for  12- 15 mins or until the chicken is done.
        Set aside.
        <li><h3>STEP</h3></li>
        While the chicken is cooking you can start working on the plantains.
        Deep fry the plantain pieces until they are light golden brown for about 3-4 mins.
        You don't want to make them very crunchy the inside should remain mushy.
        Alternatively you could also steam the plantains for a lighter variation.
        <li><h3>STEP</h3></li>
        Mash the plantains like  you would potatoes.
        And then add garlic, green onions and some olive oil to the mashed plantains.
        Season with some salt.
        <li><h3>FINAL STEP</h3></li>
        Form molds on a plate with your hands and fill it up with the chicken filling.
        Sprinkle some fresh cilantro on top and serve with a wedge of lime. Buen provecho!
