        <h3>Ingredients: </h3>
     </p>   
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li> 6 snapper fish, or red grouper, ½ lb [0.45 kg] each (see notes above recipe)</li>
            <li> 5 cloves garlic, mashed</li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon bija (annato, achiote) powder, (optional)</li>
            <li> 1½ teaspoon salt, (more may be needed)</li>
            <li> 4 tablespoons vegetable oil, (corn, canola or peanut)</li>
            <li> 2 bell pepper, (whichever color) cut into strips</li>
            <li> 1 onion, cut into strips</li>
            <li> 4 cup coconut milk, (or canned)</li>
            <li> 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro, plus extra sprigs to garnish</li>
            <li> 1 lime, cut into wedges to garnish</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

            <li>STEP</li> 
            Clean the fish. Score diagonal cuts on the fish about 1.5 inches [4 cm] from each other.
            Mix the garlic, annatto, and salt. Rub the fish with the mixture, making sure it penetrates into the cuts. The annatto does stain your hands, but it can be easily washed off.
            <li>STEP</li>
            Heat oil in a large skillet (12" [30 cm]) over medium-high heat.
            Cook the fish lightly on one side (it'll change color a bit), rotate, and cook the other side equally. Remove the fish from the pan and set aside.
            <li>STEP</li>
            Add the bell pepper and onion, and cook until the onions become translucent.
            Add the coconut milk and set heat to medium. 
            <li>STEP</li>
            Place the fish in the pan. Cook and rotate the fish regularly but be careful that it stays whole.
            When the liquid has reduced by half, taste the sauce and season with salt to taste. Sprinkle with the minced cilantro and remove from the heat.
            <li>FINAL STEP</li>
            Garnish with cilantro sprigs and lime wedges and serve. See some serving suggestions above the recipe. Buen Provecho!
